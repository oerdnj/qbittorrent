qBittorrent - A BitTorrent client in C++ / Qt4
------------------------------------------

1) Compile and install qBittorrent with Qt4 Graphical Interface

  $ ./configure
  $ make && make install
  $ qbittorrent

  will install and execute qBittorrent hopefully without any problems.

  Dependencies:
    - Qt >= 4.6.0 (libqtgui, libqtcore, libqtnetwork, libqtxml, libqtdbus/optional)

    - pkg-config executable

    - libtorrent-rasterbar by Arvid Norberg (>= 1.0.6)
        -> http://www.libtorrent.net
        Be careful: another library (the one used by rTorrent) uses a similar name.

    - libboost >= 1.35.x (libboost-system)

    - python >= 2.3 (needed by search engine)
        * Run time only dependency

    - geoip-database (optional)
        * If qBittorrent cannot find this database, it will try to resolve countries using the Internet but it will be a lot slower.
        * Run time only dependency

2) Compile and install qBittorrent without Qt4 Graphical interface

  $ ./configure --disable-gui
  $ make && make install
  $ qbittorrent

  will install and execute qBittorrent hopefully without any problems.

  Dependencies:
    - Qt >= 4.4.0 (libqt-devel, libqtcore, libqtnetwork)

    - pkg-config executable

    - libtorrent-rasterbar by Arvid Norberg (>= v1.0.6)
        -> http://www.libtorrent.net
        Be careful: another library (the one used by rTorrent) uses a similar name.

    - libboost: libboost-filesystem, libboost-date-time, libboost-thread, libboost-serialization
