qbittorrent (2.4.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  qBittorrent version 2.3.0 (not packaged for Debian) introduced an
  incompatible change with the torrent save path system.
  Users upgrading from version 2.2.x (2.2.11-1 is the latest available point
  release in Debian) should make a backup of the following directory in case
  they want to switch back to a version older than 2.3.0:

    ~/.local/share/data/qBittorrent/BT_backup/

qbittorrent (2.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting from this new release qBittorrent will comply with the XDG Base
  Directory Specification by storing its .torrent files in ~/.local instead of
  the ~/.qbittorrent directory used so far.
  In case you wish to switch back to an earlier version you will need to move
  your torrents back to the old folder with the following commands:
    $ mkdir ~/.qbittorrent/
    $ cp -a ~/.local/share/data/qBittorrent/BT_backup/ ~/.qbittorrent/

  This new release comes with a new binary package. qBittorrent-nox version of
  qBittorrent that does not require X and can be controlled via a WebUI, thus is
  more suitable for headless servers. The default account username and password
  are mentioned in qbittorrent-nox(1) manpage.
